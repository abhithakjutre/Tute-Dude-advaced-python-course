# Why do we use list in python

# Use without list
'''
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4
e = 5
print(c)
This method is complex and, i create multiple variable so this is not good in efficent programming
'''
# using list
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5] # for indexing start from 0 like this 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
print(numbers[2]) # so i print 3 number then i enter index 2
