**Project Title:** Pythonic Fun
**Tagline:** Exploring the world of Python programming through interactive tasks and projects

**📖 Description**
----------------

Pythonic Fun is a collection of Python projects designed to help beginners and intermediate programmers develop their skills and confidence in the language. The project includes two tasks that demonstrate various aspects of Python programming, including input/output operations, string manipulation, and basic arithmetic operations. The tasks are designed to be interactive, allowing users to input their own values and see the results.

In this project, you will find two Python files: `Task1.py` and `Task2.py`. `Task1.py` focuses on basic arithmetic operations, while `Task2.py` explores string manipulation and input/output operations. By running these tasks, you will gain hands-on experience with Python and develop a deeper understanding of its capabilities.

**✨ Features**
--------------

1. **Interactive Tasks**: Both `Task1.py` and `Task2.py` are designed to be interactive, allowing users to input their own values and see the results.
2. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: `Task1.py` demonstrates basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. **String Manipulation**: `Task2.py` explores string manipulation, allowing users to input their first and last names and see their full name printed in a welcoming message.
4. **Input/Output Operations**: Both tasks showcase input/output operations, enabling users to interact with the program and see the results.
5. **Easy to Use**: The tasks are designed to be easy to use, with clear instructions and minimal setup required.
6. **Cross-Platform Compatible**: The Python scripts are compatible with all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
7. **Extensive Comments**: The code includes extensive comments, making it easy for beginners to understand and modify the tasks.
8. **Reusable Code**: The tasks can be easily modified and extended to create more complex programs.

* `README.md` contains this documentation and information about the project.

**⚙️ How to Run**
----------------

### Setup

1. Install Python on your computer if you haven't already.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the project.

### Environment

* Python 3.x (any version) is required to run the tasks.

### Build

1. Simply run the Python files using the command `python Task1.py` or `python Task2.py`.

### Deploy

No deployment is required, as the tasks can be run locally on your computer.

**🧪 Testing Instructions**
-------------------------

To test the tasks, follow these steps:

1. Run the Python files using the commands `python Task1.py` and `python Task2.py`.
2. Follow the prompts and input your own values to see the results.
3. Verify that the output is correct and the program runs as expected.
